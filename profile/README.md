We conduct and support research on various aspects of multi-agent LLMs, including but not limited to:

- Coordination and communication between agents
- Decisions and reasoning in multi-agent systems
- Scalability and efficiency of multi-agent systems
- Applications of multi-agent LLMs in downstream applications
- Developing standards and best practices for multi-agent AI
